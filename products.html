                Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which a
                policyholder receives financial protection or reimbursement
                against losses from an insurer in exchange of a premium. It is a
                way to manage your risk, when you buy insurance, you purchase
                protection against unexpected financial losses. In most cases,
                the policy holder pays part of the loss (called the excess), and
                the insurer pays the rest. At Leadways Multiple Agent we offer a
                wide range of products, which are tailor made to meet the
                exclusive and distinct needs of the insuring community. Below
                are some of the products and services for individuals and
                organizations.
              </p>
              <h7><b>1. Fire Policies</b></h7>
              <p>
                These policies offer protection against loss or damage to
                property/assets caused by fire and allied perils. The sum
                insured under these policies should be equal to the replacement
                value of that property/asset. It is advised that the sum insured
                be reviewed from time to time to allow you to enjoy full cover.
                Perils covered are as follows: - Fire, lightning,
                explosion/implosion, riot, strike, malicious damage, impact by
                aircraft, flood, storm, tempest, subsidence, earthquake,
                landslide. The fire policy comes in different packages depending
                on the particular client's needs. Below is a brief description
                of the policies available:
              </p>
              <h7>a. Assets All Risks</h7>
              <p>
                This is suitable for medium to large corporates with a sizeable
                asset base. The policy requires that the sums insured be
                reflective of the replacement value and the premium is usually
                calculated based on the material damage limit. The other
                sections covered include theft as defined in the policy, money,
                transit, glass, personal effects of employees; all risks section
                which covers specified items like cell phones, bicycles. The
                cover further extends to consequential loss (loss of profit) and
                accounts receivable. These sections basically compensate the
                insured for loss of income which could have been realized if the
                loss had not occurred. Other losses covered under this section
                include claims preparation costs, fines and penalties, costs of
                hiring alternative premises, wages and salaries and other fixed

              <h7><b>COMESA YELLOW CARDS</b></h7>
              <p>
                The Yellow Card is essentially a Regional third-party motor
                vehicle insurance Scheme that provides third party legal
                liability cover and compensation for medical expenses resulting
                from road traffic accidents caused by visiting motorists.
                Besides offering third party liability protection to the insured
                or the driver whilst in a foreign country, the COMESA Yellow
                Card Scheme also offers emergency medical cover to the driver
                and passengers of the foreign motor vehicle involved in the
                traffic accident. The third-party liability cover offered is
                limited to the statute provisions on road traffic third party
                liability award limits of that country being visited and in
                which the incident has happened from.

                Risk management is a process by which organizations identify,
                assess, manage and control those risks that impact on the
                organization’s profitability and ability to produce its goods
                and services. It means knowing: <br />
                Nature of risks. <br />
                What they mean in financial terms. <br />
                What can reasonably be done to eliminate or reduce them. <br />
                What financial resources you have to absorb them economically.
                <br />
                What Insurance is necessary for the potential catastrophes,
                which remain. <br />
                Our obligation is to provide risk management consultant services
                with an aim of reducing the total cost of insurance.
