                        Personal lines insurance refers to any kind of 
                        insurance that covers individuals against loss 
                        that results from death, injury, or loss of property. 
                        These insurance lines generally protect people and 
                        their families from losses they couldnâ€™t afford to 
                        cover on their own. Personal lines insurance makes 
                        it possible to do things such as driving a car and 
                        owning a home without risking financial ruin. This 
                        is not the same as commercial lines insurance, which 
                        provides property and casualty coverage for businesses.

                      <h5>i. Home Combined</h5>
                      <p>Buildings and Contents cover is a combined home 
                        insurance policy which is designed to protect 
                        both your home and your belongings against a 
                        range of risks including <br> 1.Fire <br>2.Smoke 
                        <br>3.Storm <br>4.Flood <br>5.Subsidence <br>6.Theft.</p>

                        <h5>ii. Motor Insurance</h5>
                        <p>Motor insurance is a unique insurance policy meant 
                          for vehicle owners to protect them from incurring any 
                          financial losses that may arise due to damage or theft 
                          of the vehicle. Whether you have a private car, a 
                          commercial vehicle, or a two-wheeler, you can purchase 
                          a motor insurance policy.</p>
                          <h6>Types of insurance cover</h6>
                          <h6>a.Third Party</h6>
                          <p>
                            This cover is the legal requirement. This level of cover 
                            ensures that compensation is available for injury to other 
                            people (including your passengers) or damage to other peoples' 
                            property resulting from an accident caused by you. It doesn't 
                            cover any of your costs as the result of an accident.

                            Most insurance companies offer additional levels 
                            of insurance cover that go beyond the 
                            legal requirement. The precise nature of cover 
                            will vary from company to company.
                          </p>
                          <h6>b.Third Party Fire And Theft</h6>
                          <p>
                            This provides the same cover as third party only and also insures 
                            you should your vehicle be damaged by fire or stolen.
                          </p>
                          <h6>c.Comprehensive</h6>
                          <p>
                            This provides the same cover as third party fire and theft. However, 
                            it also covers you should your vehicle be damaged in an accident. 
                            Many additions to this level of cover are available from insurance 
                            companies including: <br>
                            -providing a courtesy car while your car is being repaired, legal 
                            expenses, insurance to recover your uninsured losses (such as your excess) <br>
                            -roadside recovery schemes <br>
                            -vehicle repairs in case of breakdown

                      <h5>i. Short-term Insurance</h5>
                      <p>Short term insurance is insurance that provides financial 
                        coverage for a specific asset for a limited duration of time, 
                        usually less than one year. For example, a person may get a 
                        short term property insurance policy that only covers their 
                        property for six months. Short term insurance is commonly 
                        used for health insurance, but it can also be used for most 
                        other types of insurance, except life insurance.
                      </p>
                      <h5>The most common types of personal short-term insurance policies include:</h5>

                        as the driver of the other vehicle.
                      </p>
                      <p><b>Third-party, fire and theft</b>â€“ includes the above, as well as cover for fire damage or theft of your vehicle.</p>
                      <p><b>Comprehensive </b>â€“ includes all the above, as well as damage to your vehicle because of an accident in which only your vehicle has been involved, hail, hijacking and vandalism, etc. according to the specifications of the specific policy.

                      <h6>b.Household Cover</h6>
                      <p><p>Homeowners insurance is a package policy. This means that it covers both damage to property and liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.</p>
                    </p>
                      <h6>c.Health Cover</h6>
                      <p>A liability insurance plan covers legal liabilities arising against a company 
                        or an individual due to property damage, bodily injuries, personal injuries, 
                        and advertising injuries to a third party. A liability insurance plan will 
                        repay the costs associated with the loss of health due to injury or sickness.</p>
                      <h6>d. Personal Libilities</h6>
                      <p>Personal liability insurance is about financial protection â€“ for you and your family. The personal liability coverage within your homeowners policy provides coverage to pay for claims of bodily injury and property damage sustained by others for which you or covered residents of your household are legally responsible.</p>

                      <h6>e. All Risk Cover</h6>
                      <p>property insurance covering loss arising from any fortuitous cause except those that are specifically excluded. This is in contrast to named perils coverage, which applies only to loss arising out of causes that are listed as covered.
                      </p>

                        <h5>ii. Risk Management</h5>
                        <p>Insurance Risk Management is the assessment and quantification of the likelihood and financial impact of events that may occur in the customer's world that require settlement by the insurer; and the ability to spread the risk of these events occurring across other insurance underwriter's in the market.</p>
                          <h5>iii. Employee Benefits</h5>
                          <p>An employee benefit insurance plan typically includes the following basic coverage package: medical health insurance, group term life insurance, prescription drug plan, and accidental death and dismemberment policies. Other companies may offer a more comprehensive package that might include dental and vision plans, short- and long-term disability insurance, and retirement plans.</p>
